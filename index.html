<h1> The RailsMUD Server </h1>

<h2> Why RailsMUD? </h1>

<p>
  RailsMUD is a simple example of what can be done with
  <a href="http://noahgibbs.github.com/RailsGame">RailsGame</a>.  It's
  a database-backed MUD that uses RailsGame for server-push and
  infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
  Since RailsMUD uses Rails and Juggernaut, you can play directly on
  the web page, without a telnet client and without inefficient AJAX
  polling constantly.  In fact, by default RailsMUD doesn't support
  a telnet client, though you could build that into your game server
  if you wanted to.
</p>

<p>
  Since RailsMUD is database-backed, you can directly edit in-game
  objects with the Rails server pages, and otherwise see a lot of
  what's going on.
</p>

<p>
  Mostly, though, it's a good proof of concept, not by any means a
  full-on functioning MUD with all the features you'd expect.
</p>

<h2> Who Can Use a RailsMUD? </h2>

<p>
  Currently, anybody with Flash 8 or higher installed in their browser
  of choice.  That's almost everybody, these days.  RailsGame is
  compatible with any browser you can write clean JavaScript or HTML
  for.
</p>

<h2> Installing RailsMUD </h2>

<p>
  RailsMUD can be found
  on <a href="http://github.com/noahgibbs/RailsMUD">GitHub</a>.  You'll
  need to download the git repository and then do appropriate setup.
  See the INSTALL file for details.
