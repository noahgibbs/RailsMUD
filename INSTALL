Installing:

  You'll need a basically Rails-friendly setup already.  This assumes that
things like "./script/server" already work.  If you don't know what that means,
you should probably be relying on somebody else's prepackaged version of
this software.

Steps

[ TODO: make this a 'run a script' step instead of involved and manual. ]

* First, "cp pv.sh private_variables.sh", and change the appropriate values.
This will set up your outbound mail server, admin account, passwords and
so on.  Basically all private variables should wind up in this file.  That
means you should never give read access to the file to anybody who isn't
head administrator of your MUD.

* Second, "cp config/jh.yml config/juggernaut_hosts.yml" and change the
appropriate values to match the domain of your game, and the deployment
mode if you changed that.

SECURITY

There are cryptographic keys in several files that you should change.
You can find cryptographic keys in the files
config/initializers/site_keys.rb,
config/initializers/session_store.rb, and game/jugger_keys.rb.

If you just use the default values then they're not any good as
cryptographic keys and your MUD can be hijacked in all sorts of awful
ways!
