Installing:

  You'll need a basically Rails-friendly setup already.  This assumes that
things like "./script/server" already work.  If you don't know what that means,
you should probably be relying on somebody else's prepackaged version of
this software.

Steps

[ TODO: see what more of this can be automated ]

* First, "cp pv.sh private_variables.sh", and change the appropriate
values.  This will set up your outbound mail server, admin account,
passwords and so on.  Basically all private variables should wind up
in this file.  That means you should never give read access to the
file to anybody who isn't head administrator of your MUD.

* Now type "rake db:migrate" from the root directory of RailsMUD.
It's a standard Rails thing, but if you don't then you'll get an ugly
SQL error when you try to log in.
